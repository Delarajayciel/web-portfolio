but if not working or showed just a white screen, you can:
1. click the "code" icon
2. click local
3. click download zip
4. find it on your file explorer and extract it
5. open the extracted file in your vs code or any preferred IDE
6. open terminal run "npm install" and "npm run dev" then wait a bit
7. then lastly follow the link that the terminal shows

   thanks
